# SRS-Document-for-Cafeteria-Ordering-System

I prepared a Software Requirments Specification (SRS) document, as a part of my graduate course **CPSC 541 - Software Systems, Standards and Requirements** guided by **Prof. James Choi**. This SRS document refers to Uber eats, Postmates, GrubHub, DoorDash etc., and various online food ordering systems.

The purpose of this document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the “Cafeteria Ordering System” software. It will illustrate the purpose and complete declaration for the development of system. It will also explain system constraints, interface and interactions with other external applications. This document is primarily intended to be proposed to a customer for its approval. 

**About Cafeteria Ordering System:**

Cafeteria is a virtual restaurant who plans to expand their business by building a software application which will allow users to place online meal orders and get it delivered to their desired location (home, office, any custom address etc.).

**Importance of Software Requirments**

Software requirements establish the agreement between your team and the customer on what the application is supposed to do. Without a description of what features will be included and details on how the features will work, the users of the software can’t determine if the software will meet their needs.
The importance of requirements really spans across the entire team. Without any documented requirements, many assumptions are made during the development and testing phase. Developers and designers claim poorly functioning features are that way by design, and in general, things slip through the cracks.


**Key contents in the document:**

1. Functional Requirements / Non Functional Requirments for the application
2. Product Features
3. Use Case Diagram
4. Use Case Descriptions
5. Data Flow Diagrams
6. Sequence Diagrams
7. Class Diagrams

This document deals about the importance of gathering requirements and provides a key assistance for software development and design.
